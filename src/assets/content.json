  "about": "<p>Bonjour! My name is Chrystelle and I’m a proud Cameroonian living in Brooklyn. I’m from a big family and have always loved to cook for big groups. During the pandemic I began preparing family dinners out of my home for friends and neighbors. I’ve been lucky to travel around the world and meet chefs from very different backgrounds and ingredients from different countries: coconut milk from thailand, sumac from turkey, scorpian peppers from mexico, blended together with the same mortar and pestle I travelled from Cameroon with.</p><p>I combine African ingredients and spices with fresh produce from my garden and farmers markers. I use high quality free range meat and poultry. Every week while school is in session I make a meat, a fish, and a vegetarian dinner. I’m gluten intolerant so most of my dishes have little or no gluten and I also pack things like nuts or cheeses on the side in case people have allergies. I can’t wait for you to try my cuisine, it’s truly a blend of many cultures.</p><p>I'm also available for catering if you'd like to host a party with authentic African fare, just fill out the contact form and make sure to include any dietary restrictions as well as the time and location of your event. I've done small intimate parties for less than 10 all the way up to conventions of more than 100.</p><p>Swing by any Tuesday evening around 5:30 to see what we’re all about or shoot me a DM on instagram blended together with the same mortar and pestle I travelled from Cameroon with.</p><p>I combine African ingredients and spices with fresh produce from my garden and farmers markers.

  "menu": "<p>Menu Lorem Ipsum here, Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>",
  "boutique": "<p>here are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p><p>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>",
  "contact": "<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>"
